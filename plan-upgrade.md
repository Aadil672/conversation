# Upgrading your plan
{: #plan-upgrade}

You can explore the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service extensively with the Lite plan. However, there are limits to what you can do.
{: shortdesc}

## Limits by artifact
For information about artifact limits per plan, see these topics:

- [Workspaces](configure-workspace.html#workspace-limits)
- [Dialog nodes](dialog-build.html#dialog-node-limits)
- [Intents](intents.html#intent-limits)
- [Entities](entities.html#entity-limits)
- [Logs](logs_convo.html#log-limits)

## API call limits
The number of API calls allowed per instance depends on your service plan. See your plan description for details.

If you have a Lite plan and reach your API call limit, but the logs show that you have made fewer calls than expected, remember that the Lite plan stores log information for only 7 days.

## Upgrading a service

To upgrade your plan, complete these steps:

1.  From the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} menu, select **Services** > **Dashboard**.
1.  Select the service instance that you want to upgrade to open it.
1.  Click **Plan** from the navigation pane.
   From here, you can see your current plan and other available plan options, and make changes.
