### Limits by artifact
{: #limits}

For information about artifact limits per plan, see these topics:

- [Workspaces](configure-workspace.html#workspace-limits)
- [Dialog nodes](dialog-build.html#dialog-node-limits)
- [Intents](intents.html#intent-limits)
- [Entities](entities.html#entity-limits)

### API call limits
{: #api-limits}

The number of API calls allowed per instance depends on your service plan. See your plan description for details.

If you have a Lite plan and reach your API call limit, but the logs show that you have made fewer calls than expected, remember that the Lite plan stores log information for only 7 days.

If you want to upgrade from one plan to another, see [Upgrading](upgrading.html).
